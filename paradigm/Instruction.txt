In this experiment, you will be presented with letter strings on the screen, for example, 'rekagable'. Your task is to memorize these strings. 
You have as much time as you need for memorization: By HOLDING THE SPACEBAR for as long as you want you control how long the first string will be shown. Once you RELEASE THE SPACEBAR the string will disappear from the screen, and after a short delay another string will appear. The new string will be either IDENTICAL OR DIFFERENT from the one you memorized. 

1. If the two strings are IDENTICAL press the J-KEY. 
2. If the two strings are DIFFERENT press the F-KEY. 

J and F are two keys on your keyboard, both marked with a small bumpy ridge on them.

Thank you for your participation and please remain concentrated!
